    This model takes an audio file as input and outputs the diarization of the speakers in the audio.
    Please upload an audio file and adjust the parameters as needed.
    
    The maximum length of the audio file that can be processed depends based on the hardware it's running on. If you are on the ZeroGPU HuggingFace Space, it's around **35-40 minutes**.
    If you find this space helpful, please ‚ù§ it.
